    description:"In automotive engineering, an inlet manifold or intake manifold (in American English) is the part of an engine that supplies the fuel/air mixture to the cylinders.[1] The word manifold comes from the Old English word manigfeald (from the Anglo-Saxon manig [many] and feald [repeatedly]) and refers to the multiplying of one (pipe) into many.[2]"

    trackerId:'42',
    description:"A camshaft is a shaft that contains a row of pointed cams, in order to convert rotational motion to reciprocating motion. Camshafts are used in piston engines (to operate the intake and exhaust valves),[1][2] mechanically controlled ignition systems and early electric motor speed controllers."

    title:'Engine Block',
    trackerId:'42',
    description:"In an internal combustion engine, the engine block is the structure which contains the cylinders and other components. In an early automotive engine, the engine block consisted of just the cylinder block, to which a separate crankcase was attached. Modern engine blocks typically have the crankcase integrated with the cylinder block as a single component. Engine blocks often also include elements such as coolant passages and oil galleries."

    title:'Timing Chain',
    trackerId:'42',
    description:"In a piston engine, either a timing belt (also called a cambelt) or timing chain or set of timing gears is used to synchronize the rotation of the crankshaft and the camshaft. This synchronisation ensures that the engine's valves open and close at the correct times in relation to the position of the pistons."

    title:'Low Pressure Compressor',
    trackerId:'43',
    description:"The task of this compressor is to ingest air and compress it before it is fed into the combustor. Advanced engines have both a low-pressure and a high-pressure compressor. Also known as a booster, the low-pressure compressor is responsible for precompressing the air."

    title:'High Pressure Compressor',
    trackerId:'43',
    description:"Jet engines take in a great amount of surrounding air through their inlet. Behind the inlet is the compressor section. The compressor section, as you may have already guessed, compresses this incoming air. The compressor's job is to increase the pressure of the incoming air before it reaches the combustion section."

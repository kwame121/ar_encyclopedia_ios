{"text":["A prokaryote (/proʊˈkærioʊt, -ət/) is a single-celled organism that lacks a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles.[1] The word prokaryote comes from the Greek πρό (pro, 'before') and κάρυον (karyon, 'nut' or 'kernel').[2][3] In the two-empire system arising from the work of Édouard Chatton, prokaryotes were classified within the empire Prokaryota.[4] But in the three-domain system, based upon molecular analysis, prokaryotes are divided into two domains: Bacteria (formerly Eubacteria) and Archaea (formerly Archaebacteria). Organisms with nuclei are placed in a third domain, Eukaryota.[5] In the study of the origins of life, prokaryotes are thought to have arisen before eukaryotes."]}

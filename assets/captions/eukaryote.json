{"text":["Eukaryotes are organisms whose cells contain a nucleus and other membrane-bound organelles. There is a wide range of eukaryotic organisms, including all animals, plants, fungi, and protists, as well as most algae. Eukaryotes may be either single-celled or multicellular. Eukaryotes are differentiated from another class of organisms called prokaryotes by way of the presence of internal membranes that separate parts of the eukaryotic cell from the rest of the cytoplasm. These membrane-bound structures are called organelles."]}

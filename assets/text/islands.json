{"text":["An island (or isle) is an isolated piece of habitat that is surrounded by a dramatically different habitat, such as water.[1] Very small islands such as emergent land features on atolls can be called islets, skerries, cays or keys. An island in a river or a lake island may be called an eyot or ait, and a small island off the coast may be called a holm. Sedimentary islands in the Ganges Delta are called chars. A grouping of geographically or geologically related islands, such as the Philippines, is referred to as an archipelago.",
"There are two main types of islands in the sea: continental and oceanic. There are also artificial islands, which are man-made."
